# <Password-Generator>
## Description
The goal of this project was to create an application that enables users to generate random passwords based on criterea the user selects. The project began with starter code, so the main focus of the activity was writing the javascript. The main lesson I learned from this project is the importance of pseudocoding. Having my steps mapped out beforehand was critical in completing the task, and staying organized.

## Usage
To use the application, simply visit (deployed site) and follow the prompts. Make sure to click the "clear password" button in order to generate a second password.
